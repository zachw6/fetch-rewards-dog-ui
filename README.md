# Accessing the application

This application is able to be accessed at https://zachw6.github.io/fetch-rewards-dog-ui/.

# Project Information

The goal of this application was to create a front-end which interacted with Fetch's front-end takehome service to allow a user to search for dogs, favorite dogs, and match with an individual dog based on their favorites. 

The application was built with Typescript, React, Material UI components, Axios, and React Query. Where applicable, Zod was used for validating inputs.

# Testing

Due to a shortage in time, I chose to not add a testing suite to this application. However, if I were to do so, I would have used React Testing Library and created a mock API to fully test each component.

# Local Development (How to run the application)

Requirements:

- \>= Node 22
- \>= NPM 8.3

Run the command: `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

To run the application, use the command: `npm run dev`.

This will spin up the development server which can be accessed at http://localhost:5173/fetch-rewards-dog-ui

If the port 5173 is already in use, the development server will spin up on the next available port.

# Generating the build

The build for the project can be generated by running the command: `npm run build` which will output to the `dist` directory.
